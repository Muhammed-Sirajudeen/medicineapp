# medicineapp

A fully functional python gui application that
tells about the use of certain medicines and
its application. This application has Mysql
as its backend and Python on its front end
This project was developed for my Cbse 12th
computer science board exam project
I have also included the server file for
persons who want to set this environment in
a remote manner.
Not beginner friendly.
Also some of the code is repetitive as the
school wanted to have 300 lines of code at least
😁.
